1) how hashmap internally works?
  hashmap internally calucaltes the hashcode of key, then the bucket index based on bucket index it will store that value
  if it returns same hashcode, equals() came into picture, if both keys are same it will override, if not it adds the new value
  if the list size is more than 8, it converts linked list to redblacktree
  forex: map.put(1,"sree")
         map.put(1,"mouni")
as the key is same for both, same hashcode, initial it stores values 1, sree.. now equals check whether the key is same or not 
when we want to add 1, mouni as it same override sree with mouni
2) what happens when we override equals but not hashcode or vice-versa?
   may be a chance of duplicates. consider the same above example, if I dont override hashcode it will retun diff hashes
   so it may stored at 2 diff places , with the same key we may have duplicate values
