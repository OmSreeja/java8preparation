@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue

Repositories: JpaRepository, CrudRepository

@Query (JPQL, Native Query)

Pagination and Sorting

Transactions: @Transactional

Lazy vs Eager loading

Datasource configuration

Database migration tools (Flyway, Liquibase)

Interview Qns:

What is the difference between Hibernate and JPA?

How does Spring Data JPA simplify CRUD operations?

How does @Transactional work internally?

What’s the default transaction propagation behavior?

Difference between save() and saveAndFlush()?

🔹 6️⃣ Exception Handling

Topics:

@ControllerAdvice

@ExceptionHandler

ResponseEntityExceptionHandler

Custom exceptions & global error response

Interview Qns:

How to handle global exceptions in Spring Boot?

What’s the difference between checked & unchecked exceptions in controller?

🔹 7️⃣ REST API Development

Topics:

@RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping

RequestBody vs RequestParam vs PathVariable

ResponseEntity usage

Validation → @Valid, @NotNull, @Email, @Pattern

JSON Serialization/Deserialization using Jackson

Interview Qns:

What’s difference between @Controller and @RestController?

How does Spring Boot convert JSON to object internally?

How do you validate request payloads?

🔹 8️⃣ Spring Boot Testing

Topics:

@SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest

MockMvc for controller testing

Mockito and @MockBean usage

Unit vs Integration tests

Interview Qns:

How to test REST controllers in Spring Boot?

What’s the difference between @Mock and @MockBean?

🔹 9️⃣ Actuator & Monitoring

Topics:

Actuator Endpoints (/actuator/health, /metrics, /env)

Custom endpoints

Securing Actuator endpoints

Interview Qns:

What is Spring Boot Actuator used for?

How to expose only specific actuator endpoints?

🔹 🔟 Spring Boot Security (Basic + JWT)

Topics:

Spring Security filters & Authentication flow

@EnableWebSecurity

Basic Authentication vs JWT

Custom UserDetailsService

PasswordEncoder

Security configuration (Spring Security 6)

Interview Qns:

How does Spring Security work internally?

What’s the role of SecurityFilterChain?

How to implement JWT authentication in Spring Boot?

🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ Advanced Concepts

Topics:

AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): @Aspect, @Before, @AfterReturning, @Around

Scheduler: @EnableScheduling, @Scheduled

Caching: @EnableCaching, @Cacheable, @CacheEvict

File Upload/Download

DevTools, Logging, Profiles

Interview Qns:

What is AOP? How is it used in Spring Boot?

What is pointcut and joinpoint?

What is the difference between @Cacheable and @CacheEvict?

🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ Microservices & Integration

Topics:

REST communication between services

Feign Client / RestTemplate / WebClient

Centralized Configuration (Spring Cloud Config)

Service Discovery (Eureka)

Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j)

Distributed Tracing (Sleuth, Zipkin)

Messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ / IBM MQ integration)

Interview Qns:

How do services communicate in microservices?

How to secure service-to-service calls?

How to handle failure using circuit breaker pattern?
