**What is lambda expression..?**
 A lambda expression is a short, anonymous way to write an implementation of a functional interface.
 Itâ€™s a concise replacement for creating an anonymous inner class.
 Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Running");
Comparator<String> c = (a, b) -> a.compareTo(b);
**Benefits:**
Less boilerplate code
Improved readability
Enables functional programming
Cleaner use with Streams, Collections, Threading
