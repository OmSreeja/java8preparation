before spring 
Objects new keyword tho create cheyyali
Tight coupling
Testing impossible without full object graph
Changing implementation = code change everywhere

Spring solution (HOW)
Spring IoC Container introduce chesindhi.
“Spring takes control of object creation, dependency wiring, lifecycle management.”
Internally em jaruguthundhi?
Spring container startup avvagane:
Classpath scan chesthundhi
@Component unna classes identify chesthundhi
Object create chesthundhi
Dependencies inject chesthundhi
Bean ready

BEAN LIFECYCLE – INTERNAL FLOW (PFI LEVEL)
❓ Bean lifecycle explain cheyyandi
Ila cheppu 👇
“When application starts, Spring creates beans, injects dependencies, initializes them, and manages them until shutdown.”
🔍 Internally steps:
Bean instantiation
Dependency injection
@PostConstruct
Bean ready
@PreDestroy (shutdown time)

@SpringBootApplication – DEEP (NOT BASIC)
❓ What happens when main method runs?
SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);
🔍 Internally:
Create ApplicationContext
Load environment
Scan components
Apply auto-configurations
Start embedded server (Tomcat)

@SpringBootApplication breakdown
It combines:
@Configuration → Java-based config
@ComponentScan → scans beans
@EnableAutoConfiguration → magic happens here
5️⃣ AUTO-CONFIGURATION – REAL DEPTH 🔥🔥
❓ How Spring Boot auto-config works internally?
Ila cheppu 👇
“Spring Boot checks classpath dependencies and configuration properties, then conditionally creates beans.”

Important annotations:
@ConditionalOnClass
@ConditionalOnProperty
@ConditionalOnMissingBean
🔥 Impressive line:
“Spring Boot creates beans only if we haven’t defined our own.”

TRANSACTIONS – DEEP (Accenture loves this)
❓ How @Transactional works internally?
IMPORTANT 🔥
“Spring creates a proxy around the bean. Method call goes through proxy which starts and commits or rolls back transaction.”
🔥 Why runtime exception rollback?
Because Spring marks transaction rollback-only
❓ Why checked exception not rollback?
Assumed recoverable
Can override using rollbackFor
